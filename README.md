## ☎️ Mobile and Web developer with 7+ years of experience.

The more I learn about software, the more I see what makes companies spend millions in products that doesn't attract the public, or doesn't work, and spend 20 times more money to try to fix it.

Software is expensive, and it should be well planned, well executed and well tested.

Achieving good software requirements and choosing the right architecture for the product and executing it iteratively with requirement test are the goals of my career.

Help companies to achieve their goals in a shorter time and spending only the necessary amount of resources is what matters to me.
